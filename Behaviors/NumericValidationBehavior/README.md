# NumericValidation Behavior

Xamarin.Forms behaviors are created in a class that derives from the Behavior, or Behavior&lt;T&gt; class. This sample demonstrates how to create and consume a Xamarin.Forms behavior.

For more information about this sample, see [Behaviors](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/behaviors/).

```xaml
<Entry Placeholder="Enter a System.Double">
    <Entry.Behaviors>
        <local:NumericValidationBehavior />
    </Entry.Behaviors>
</Entry>
```
