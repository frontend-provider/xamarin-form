Event to Command Behavior
=========================

In the context of commanding, behaviors are a useful approach for connecting a control to a command. In addition, they can also be used to associate commands with controls that were not designed to interact with commands. This sample demonstrates using a behavior to invoke a command when an event fires.

For more information about this sample, see [Behaviors](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/behaviors/).
