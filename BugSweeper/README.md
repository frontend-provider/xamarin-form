BugSweeper
======

This is a familiar game with a new twist. Ten bugs are hidden in a 9-by-9 grid of tiles.
To win, you must find and flag all ten bugs.

**If you open the solution in Xamarin Studio, it will not be able to load the Windows Phone project;
and if you open the solution in Xamarin Studio under Windows, it will not be able to load the iOS project either.**

Begin playing by double tapping any tile. That first double tap is always safe.
Thereafter, numbers indicate the number of surrounding tiles with bugs. 
If you know that a tile has a bug, flag it (or unflag it) with a single tap.
Avoid double-tapping a tile with a bug!
