# Xamarin Forms Image Resizer

This app loads an image that is embedded as a resource in a shared project, resizes it, and then displays it on the screen. It's a cross-platform image resizer that works in Xamarin.Forms shared projects and will resize images on iOS, Android, and the Universal Windows Platform.
