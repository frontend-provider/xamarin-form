ClassHierarchy
==============

This program uses .NET reflection to display a scrollable hierarchy of all Xamarin.Forms classes, structures, and enumerations.
Non-instantiable classes are displayed in the system accent color.

**If you open the solution in Xamarin Studio, it will not be able to load the Windows Phone project;
and if you open the solution in Xamarin Studio under Windows, it will not be able to load the iOS project either.**

ClassHierarchy is a handy reference for Xamarin.Forms developers, as well as demonstrating using 
the StackLayout and ScrollView from code.

The solution contains four projects: the iOS, Android, and Windows Phone projects are small and standard
Xamarin.Forms stub applications. All the common application code is in the ClassHierarchy portable class library.
