# Xamarin.Forms Localization Demo

Localization is the process of adapting an application to meet the specific language or cultural requirements of a target market. This sample localizes text and images for multiple supported cultures.

For more information about this sample, see [Xamarin.Forms Localization](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/localization/text).
