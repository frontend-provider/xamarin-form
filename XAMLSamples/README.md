XAML Samples
==============

XAML—the eXtensible Application Markup Language—allows developers to define user interfaces in Xamarin.Forms applications using markup rather than code. XAML is never required in a Xamarin.Forms program but it is often more succinct than equivalent code, more visually coherent, and potentially toolable. XAML is particularly well suited for use with the popular MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) application architecture: XAML defines the View that is linked to ViewModel code through XAML-based data bindings.

These samples relate to the XAML for Xamarin.Forms documentation which are found [here](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/xaml-for-xamarin-forms/).


**If you open the solution in Xamarin Studio, it will not be able to load the Windows Phone project;
and if you open the solution in Xamarin Studio under Windows, it will not be able to load the iOS project either.**
