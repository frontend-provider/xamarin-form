	<Brief>Application indexing allows applications that would otherwise be forgotten after a few uses to stay relevant by appearing in search results. Deep linking allows applications to respond to a search result that contains application data, typically by navigating to a page referenced from a deep link. This sample demonstrates how to use application indexing and deep linking to make Xamarin.Forms application content searchable on iOS and Android devices.</Brief>
