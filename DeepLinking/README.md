Deep Linking
============

Application indexing allows applications that would otherwise be forgotten after a few uses to stay relevant by appearing in search results. Deep linking allows applications to respond to a search result that contains application data, typically by navigating to a page referenced from a deep link. This sample demonstrates how to use application indexing and deep linking to make Xamarin.Forms application content searchable on iOS and Android devices.

For more information about this sample, see [Application Indexing and Deep Linking](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/working-with/deep-linking/).
