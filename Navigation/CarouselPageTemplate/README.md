# CarouselPageTemplate

This sample demonstrates how to use a `CarouselPage` to navigate through a collection of pages. The `CarouselPage` is constructed by assigning a collection to the `ItemsSource` property and assigning a `DataTemplate` to the `ItemTemplate` property to return pages for objects in the collection.

For more information about the sample see [Carousel Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/navigation/carousel-page).
