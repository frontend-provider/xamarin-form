TabbedPage
==========

This sample demonstrates how to use a `TabbedPage` to navigate through a collection of pages. The `TabbedPage` is constructed by assigning a collection to the `ItemsSource` property and assigning a `DataTemplate` to the `ItemTemplate` property to return pages for objects in the collection.

For more information about the sample see [Tabbed Page](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/user-interface/navigation/tabbed-page/).
