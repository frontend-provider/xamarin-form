# Dependency Resolution (Factory Methods)

This sample demonstrates how to inject a dependency resolution method into Xamarin.Forms, so that custom renderers, effects, and DependencyService implementations are created using factory methods.

For more information about this sample, see [Dependency Resolution in Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/internals/dependency-injection).
