ViewCell Custom Renderer
========================

This sample demonstrates a custom renderer for a `ViewCell` that's hosted inside a Xamarin.Forms `ListView` control, enabling developers to override the default native rendering with their own platform-specific customization.

For more information about this sample see [Customizing a ViewCell](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/custom-renderer/viewcell/).
