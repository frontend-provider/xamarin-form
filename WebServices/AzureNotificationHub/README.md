# Azure Notification Hub

This sample demonstrates how to use Azure Notification Hubs to send push notifications to Xamarin Forms applications on Android and iOS.

On iOS 13 and greater, you may experience intermittent device registration issues if your app is running over a wireless network, rather than a cellular network. For more information, and a workaround, see [iOS-13 Unable to receive Device Token](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/128172) on developer.apple.com.

To run the Android application, you must replace the google-services.json file with a file downloaded from your Firebase console.

For more information about this sample see [Push notifications with Azure Notification Hub and Xamarin Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/data-cloud/push-notifications/azure-notification-hub).
