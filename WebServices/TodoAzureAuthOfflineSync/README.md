TodoAzureAuthOfflineSync
========================

This sample demonstrates synchronizing offline data in a Xamarin.Forms application to an Azure Mobile Apps instance.

The app functionality is:

- View a list of tasks.
- Add a new item to the list of tasks.
- Set a task's status to 'completed'.

In all cases the tasks are stored locally, and are synchronized to an Azure Mobile Apps instance.

For more information about this sample see [Synchronizing Offline Data with Azure Mobile Apps](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/web-services/sync/azure-mobile-apps/).

Setting up an Azure Mobile App
------------------------------

In order to run this sample application an Azure Mobile App must first be created. When creating an Azure Mobile App instance please ensure that the service uses a Node.js backend.

For information about how to Create an Azure Mobile App that can be consumed by Xamarin.Forms, see [Consuming an Azure Mobile App](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/web-services/consuming/azure/).

For information about how to configure the Azure Mobile App instance to manage the authentication process, see [Authenticating Users with Azure Mobile Apps](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/web-services/authentication/azure/).
