TodoAzureAuth
=============

This sample demonstrates a Todo list application where the data is stored, accessed, and authenticated from an Azure Mobile App instance.

The app functionality is:

- View a list of tasks.
- Add a new item to the list of tasks.
- Set a task's status to 'completed'.

In all cases the tasks are stored in an Azure Mobile App instance.

For more information about this sample see [Consuming an Azure Mobile App](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/web-services/consuming/azure/) and [Authenticating Users with Azure Mobile Apps](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/web-services/authentication/azure/).

Setting up an Azure Mobile App
----------------------------------

In order to run this sample application an Azure Mobile App must first be created. When creating an Azure Mobile App instance please ensure that the service uses a Node.js backend.

For information about how to Create an Azure Mobile App that can be consumed by Xamarin.Forms, see [Create a Xamarin.Forms app](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-xamarin-forms-get-started/) on the Azure website.

For information about how to configure the Azure Mobile App instance to manage the authentication process, see [Add authentication to your Xamarin.Forms app](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-xamarin-forms-get-started-users/) on the Azure website.
