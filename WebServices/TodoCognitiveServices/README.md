This sample demonstrates how to use some of the Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs in a Xamarin.Forms application. Note that `Constants.cs` should be updated with API keys for the different services.

For more information about this sample see [Adding Intelligence with Cognitive Services](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/web-services/cognitive-services/).
