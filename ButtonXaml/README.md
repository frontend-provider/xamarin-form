ButtonXaml
==========

This program demonstrates how to create a *Button* in XAML and process events from it
in the code-behind file.
By default, the *Button* occupies the entire page.

The ButtonCode sample is functionally identical but demonstrates how to create a button in code.

**If you open the solution in Xamarin Studio, it will not be able to load the Windows Phone project;
and if you open the solution in Xamarin Studio under Windows, it will not be able to load the iOS project either.**
