# ContentView demos

The Xamarin.Forms `ContentView` class can be extended to create custom controls. This sample demonstrates how to create a custom `CardView` control, based on the `ContentView` class, and instantiate it in XAML, XAML with MVVM bindings, and code. This sample also demonstrates how to use a `ControlTemplate` to override the layout of a custom control such as the `CardView` class.

For more information about this sample, see [Xamarin.Forms CardView](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/layouts/contentview)
