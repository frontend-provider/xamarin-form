# ContentView demos

The Xamarin.Forms `ContentView` class can be inherited from to create custom controls. This sample demonstrates how to create a custom `CardView` control, based on the `ContentView` class, and instantiate it in XAML and code. This sample also demonstrates how to use a `ControlTemplate` to override the layout of a custom control such as the `CardView` class.
