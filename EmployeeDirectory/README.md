# Employee Directory

With Xamarin.Forms you can use C# or XAML to create layout and this sample app shows how to use both of them. To switch between user interface implementations open ~/EmployeeDirectory/EmployeeDirectoryUI/App.cs file and change `uiImplementation` variable.

Switch to XAML:

```csharp
public static class App
{
    //Change the following line to switch between XAML and C# versions
    private static UIImplementation uiImplementation = UIImplementation.Xaml;
    ...
}
```

Switch to C#:

```csharp
public static class App
{
    //Change the following line to switch between XAML and C# versions
    private static UIImplementation uiImplementation = UIImplementation.CSharp;
    ...
}
```
