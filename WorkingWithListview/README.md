Working with ListView
==============

These samples relate to the [Working with ListView in Xamarin.Forms](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/working-with/listview) doc.

Many people have questions about specific ListView features, this sample attempts to cover some of them (even if they currently require extending Xamarin.Forms right now):

* De-selecting the row after tapping
* Uneven row heights on iOS
* Adding clickable buttons to cells that work on Android

(Xaml examples still-to-come)
