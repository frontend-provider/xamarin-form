ScaleAndRotate
==============

The Xamarin.Forms *Scale* and *Rotation* properties allow a program to scale and rotate
Xamarin.Forms visual elements. In addition, the *RotationX* and *RotationY* properties perform
3D-like rotations around the X and Y axes.

ScaleAndRotate lets you interactively experiment with these properties using a *Slider*. 
All these transforms are affected by the *AnchorX* and *AnchorY* properties, which establish a pivot
point relative to the transformed view that remains in place when the transform is applied. 
*Stepper* views let you set the *AnchorX* and *AnchorY* properties to values ranging from -1 to 2, 
in increments of 0.5.
