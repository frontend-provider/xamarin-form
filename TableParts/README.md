TabbedPageDemo
==============

The Xamarin.Forms *TableView* can be used for several purposes, including a menu or list of various
views for the display of data, or program settings, or form input. Each item is an instance of a 
*Cell* derivative. This program displays the standard *Cell* derivatives and demonstrates the 
use of *ViewCell* to make your own.

**If you open the solution in Xamarin Studio, it will not be able to load the Windows Phone project;
and if you open the solution in Xamarin Studio under Windows, it will not be able to load the iOS project either.**
