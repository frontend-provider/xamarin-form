XAML Samples
============

XAML—the eXtensible Application Markup Language—allows developers to define user interfaces in Xamarin.Forms applications using markup rather than code. XAML is never required in a Xamarin.Forms program but it is often more succinct than equivalent code, more visually coherent, and potentially toolable. XAML is particularly well suited for use with the popular MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) application architecture: XAML defines the View that is linked to ViewModel code through XAML-based data bindings.

These samples relate to the [Xamarin.Forms XAML Basics](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/) article.
